## Quick Start (Recommended)

The simplest way to deploy your birthday celebration website is to use static hosting services. Here are the easiest options:

### 1. GitHub Pages (Free)

   - `index.html`
   - `manifest.json`
   - `README.md`
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. Go to Settings > Pages
4. Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose "main"
5. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

### 2. Netlify (Free)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop your project folder
3. Your site will be live instantly with a custom URL
4. You can add a custom domain later

### 3. Vercel (Free)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Deploy automatically with zero configuration

### 4. Local Testing

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser - no server required!

## File Structure

```
Birthday & Girlfriend Day Celebration/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main website file
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json       # PWA manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # Documentation

â”œâ”€â”€ Prompt.md          # Original requirements
â””â”€â”€ design.json        # Design specifications
```

## Customization Before Deployment

### 1. Add Your Photos

Replace the placeholder images in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Find these lines and replace with your photos -->
<img src="your-photo-1.jpg" alt="The moment I knew you were special" />
<img src="your-photo-2.jpg" alt="My favorite memory with you" />
<img src="your-photo-3.jpg" alt="When you make me smile the most" />
<img src="your-photo-4.jpg" alt="Happy Birthday, my love!" />
```

### 2. Personalize Messages

Edit the romantic messages and descriptions to make them personal to your relationship.

### 3. Add Audio Files

1. Create a `sounds/` folder
2. Add your audio files:
   - `welcome.mp3` - Welcome music
   - `game-complete.mp3` - Game completion sound
   - `photo-reveal.mp3` - Photo unlock sound
3. Update the JavaScript to use your audio files

### 4. Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom domain like `birthday-love.com`:

1. **Netlify**: Go to Domain settings > Add custom domain
2. **Vercel**: Go to Settings > Domains
3. **GitHub Pages**: Go to Settings > Pages > Custom domain

## Mobile Optimization

The website is already optimized for mobile, but you can enhance it further:

### 1. Test on Real Devices

- iPhone (Safari)
- Android (Chrome)
- iPad (Safari)

### 2. PWA Installation

Users can install the website as an app:

- **iOS**: Share button > Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Chrome menu > Add to Home Screen

### 3. Performance Tips

- Compress images to under 500KB each
- Use WebP format for better compression
- Test loading speed with Google PageSpeed Insights

## Security Considerations

### 1. HTTPS Required

Most hosting services provide HTTPS automatically. This is important for:

- Audio playback
- PWA installation
- Modern browser features

### 2. Privacy

The website doesn't collect any personal data, but consider:

- Adding a privacy policy if you plan to track usage
- Using analytics services like Google Analytics (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Photos not loading**

   - Check image URLs are accessible
   - Ensure images are in the correct format (JPG, PNG, WebP)
   - Verify file sizes are reasonable (< 1MB each)

2. **Audio not working**

   - Modern browsers require HTTPS for audio autoplay
   - Users may need to interact with the page first
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Mobile issues**
   - Test on different devices and browsers
   - Ensure viewport meta tag is present
   - Check touch target sizes (minimum 44px)

### Browser Support

- âœ… Chrome 90+
- âœ… Firefox 88+
- âœ… Safari 14+
- âœ… Edge 90+
- âœ… Mobile browsers

## Advanced Features

### 1. Analytics (Optional)

Add Google Analytics to track usage:

```html
<!-- Add this to the <head> section -->
<script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"
></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments);
  }
  gtag("js", new Date());
  gtag("config", "GA_MEASUREMENT_ID");
</script>
```

### 2. Social Sharing

Add social media meta tags:

```html
<!-- Add to <head> section -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Birthday & Girlfriend Day Celebration" />
<meta
  property="og:description"
  content="A special interactive celebration with cats and flowers"
/>
<meta property="og:image" content="your-preview-image.jpg" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://your-domain.com" />
```

```
